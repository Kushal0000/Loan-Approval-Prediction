# üè¶ Loan Status Prediction API

This project predicts whether a loan application will be **approved** or **not approved** using a **Machine Learning model** deployed via a **FastAPI** backend. The model is trained on real-world loan data and provides predictions through a RESTful API interface.

---

## üîç Project Overview

- Trained a **Logistic Regression** model to predict loan approval status.
- Achieved **85%+ accuracy** using key applicant features such as income, credit history, and property area.
- Built an **interactive API** using **FastAPI** to serve the model and handle prediction requests.
- Tested the API using **Postman**, ensuring fast and reliable predictions.
- Structured the backend for easy scaling, deployment, and microservice integration.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used

- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Joblib)
- **FastAPI** for API development
- **Pydantic** for input data validation
- **Postman** for testing API endpoints
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** for EDA and visualization
